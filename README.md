# Supply Chain Management Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing key aspects of Supply Chain Management using an interactive Power BI dashboard. The objective is to evaluate warehouse utilization, inventory efficiency, transportation cost, sales trends, and backorder status to support data-driven decision making.

## Objectives
- Analyze warehouse utilization and inventory efficiency
- Track inventory turnover and days of inventory sales
- Evaluate transportation cost by region and product category
- Monitor units sold over time
- Identify inventory levels and backorder patterns
- Support operational and strategic planning

## Key KPIs
- Warehouse Utilization: 34.08
- Inventory Turnover Ratio: 23.47
- Days of Inventory Sales: 16

## Key Insights
- Warehouse utilization is relatively low, indicating possible underutilization of capacity.
- Transportation costs are higher in North and West regions, especially for Electronics and Clothing categories.
- Units sold show strong growth after 2021, indicating improved demand or distribution.
- Inventory levels vary significantly across regions and categories.
- Majority of orders are fulfilled, while pending and canceled orders represent a smaller share.
- Lead time differs across categories, affecting supply chain efficiency.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel / CSV
- Data Modeling using DAX
- Data Cleaning and Analysis
